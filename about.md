Hello. I'm Farbod and this is machine learning blog. I studied electrical engineering for my bachelor's and master's degrees, but it wasn't until the end of my master's program that I realized my interests are programming and machine learning. Since then, I've been practicing these skills by studying, developing, and teaching them.

I'll try to share my learning journey with the rest of the world here. I'd be delighted if you could correct me about my content ;).
